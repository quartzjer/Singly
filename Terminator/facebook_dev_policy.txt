Facebook Platform Policy

1. Build a quality product

    1. Develop your app with your personal account. Do not create a fake
       account to manage your app. If applicable, ensure that your
       Business Manager account is up to date and accurate.
    2. Build an app that is stable and easily navigable. Be sure your app
       insights reflect a positive experience.
       [46][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    3. Ensure that your app’s content (including ads and user-generated
       content) meets our [47]Community Standards.
    4. Follow our [48]Advertising Policies for your app name, icons, and
       description.
    5. Keep your app or bot’s description and categorization up-to-date.
       [49][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    6. Don’t include promotional content in your app’s icon (ex: don’t
       overlay your icon image with “new”, “sale”, “update” or any type of
       notification jewel).
    7. Don’t confuse, deceive, defraud, mislead, spam or surprise anyone.
       [50][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    8. Keep your app’s negative feedback below our thresholds.
       [51][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    9. Follow any instructions we include in our [52]technical
       documentation.

2. Give people control

    1. Obtain consent from people before publishing content on their
       behalf.
       [53][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    2. Use publishing permissions to help people share on Facebook, not to
       send people messages from your app.
       [54][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    3. Don’t prefill any content in captions, comments, messages or the
       user message parameter of posts unless (a) it is a single hashtag
       in a post shared through our Share Dialog (but not via our APIs),
       (b) it was created by the person using your app, or (c) it was
       created by a business whose employees use your app to administer
       the business’s presence on Facebook.
       [55][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    4. Privacy Policy
       a. Provide a publicly available and easily accessible privacy
       policy that explains what data you are collecting and how you will
       use that data.
       b. Your privacy policy must not modify, supersede, or be
       inconsistent with Facebook policies. For example, user data
       obtained from us cannot be transferred to a data broker or sold,
       even if you disclose this in your privacy policy.
       c. Include your privacy policy URL in the App Dashboard.
       [56][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6

       d. Link to your privacy policy in any app store that allows you to
       do so.

       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
       e. Comply with your privacy policy.
    5. You may use [58]Account Information in accordance with your privacy
       policy and other Facebook policies. All other data may not be
       transferred outside your app, except to your service provider (per,
       Section 3.7) who needs that information to provide services to your
       app. With the exception of Account Information, you may only
       maintain user data obtained from us for as long as necessary for
       your business purpose.
    6. Delete all of a person’s data you have received from us (including
       friend data) if that person asks you to, unless you are required to
       keep it by law, regulation, or separate agreement with us. You may
       keep aggregated data only if no information identifying a specific
       person could be inferred or created from it.
    7. Obtain consent from people before using their data in any ad.
    8. Obtain adequate consent from people before using any Facebook
       technology that allows us to collect and process data about them,
       including for example, our SDKs and browser pixels. When you use
       such technology, provide an appropriate disclosure:
       a. That third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web
       beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive
       information from your websites, apps and elsewhere on the internet
       and use that information to provide measurement services, target
       ads and as described in our [59]Data Policy; and
       b. How users can opt-out of the collection and use of information
       for ad targeting and where a user can access a mechanism for
       exercising such choice.
       [60][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    9. In jurisdictions that require informed consent for the storing and
       accessing of cookies or other information on an end user’s device
       (such as the European Union), ensure, in a verifiable manner, that
       an end user provides the necessary consent before you use Facebook
       technologies that enable us to store and access cookies or other
       information on the end user’s device. For suggestions on
       implementing consent mechanisms, visit [61]Facebook’s Cookie
       Consent Guide for Sites and Apps.
   10. Obtain consent from people before you give us information that you
       independently collected from them.
   11. Provide meaningful customer support for your app, and make it easy
       for people to contact you.
   12. If people come to your app from the Facebook app on iOS, give them
       an option to go back to the Facebook app by using the Back to
       Facebook banner provided in our SDK.
   13. If people come to your app from the Facebook app on Android, don’t
       prevent them from going back to Facebook when they press the system
       back button.

3. Protect data

    1. Protect the information you receive from us against unauthorized
       access, use, or disclosure. For example, don't use data obtained
       from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance.
    2. Only show data obtained from a user access token on the devices
       associated with that token.
    3. Only use friend data (including friends list) in the person’s
       experience in your app.
    4. If you cache data you receive from us, use it to improve your app’s
       user experience and keep it up to date.
       [62][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    5. Don’t proxy, request or collect Facebook usernames or passwords.
    6. Keep private your secret key and access tokens. You can share them
       with an agent acting to operate your app if they sign a
       confidentiality agreement.
    7. Don't use a service provider in connection with your use of
       Platform unless you make them sign a contract to: (a) protect any
       user data you obtained from us (that is at least as protective as
       our terms and policies), (b) limit their use of that user data
       solely to using it on your behalf to provide services to your app
       (and not for their own purposes or any other purposes), and (c)
       keep it secure and confidential. You must ensure they comply with
       our terms and policies (and are responsible for their
       non-compliance).
    8. Keep Facebook user IDs within your control. You can only share them
       with service providers who help you build or run your app. Ensure
       that they keep the user IDs secure and confidential and comply with
       our policies (ex: see, 3.7). If you need an anonymous unique
       identifier to share with service providers, use our [63]mechanism.
    9. Don't sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our
       services.
   10. Don't directly or indirectly transfer any data that you receive
       from us (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad
       network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related
       service. By “indirectly” we mean you aren’t allowed to, for
       example, transfer data to a third party who then transfers the data
       to an ad network.
   11. Don't put Facebook data in a search engine or directory, or include
       web search functionality on Facebook.
   12. If you are acquired by or merge with a third party, you can
       continue to use our data only within your app.
   13. If you stop using Platform, promptly delete all user data you have
       received from us (absent explicit consent from people). You can
       keep [64]Account Information if you have presented your privacy
       policy within your app.
   14. If you use friend data from Facebook to establish social
       connections in your app, only do so if each person in that
       connection has granted you access to that information.
   15. Don't use data obtained from Facebook to make decisions about
       eligibility, including whether to approve or reject an application
       or how much interest to charge on a loan.
   16. If you implement or have previously implemented (on your own behalf
       or on behalf of a third party) any Facebook Tools / Facebook
       Business Tools (as defined in our standard terms for such Facebook
       Tools /Facebook Business Tools (“Facebook Business Tools Terms”),
       currently available at:
       https://www.facebook.com/customaudiences/app/tos, or any successor
       terms we may make available, including at:
       https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools, you acknowledge
       that the Facebook Business Tools Terms apply in connection with
       your usage of Platform, including for optimization of Platform
       and/or the related Facebook Company Product.

4. Encourage proper use

    1. Add something unique to the community. Don’t replicate core
       functionality that Facebook already provides.
    2. Respect the way Facebook looks and functions. Don't offer
       experiences that change it.
       [65][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    3. If you’re building an app with a personalized or social experience,
       enable people to easily share on Facebook content they've created.
    4. Respect the limits we've placed on Facebook functionality.
       [66][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    5. Only incentivize a person to log into your app, enter a promotion
       on your app’s Page, check-in at a place, or to use Messenger to
       communicate with your business. Don’t incentivize other actions.
       [67][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    6. Encourage people to accurately tag and share content.
       [68][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    7. If your service integrates a person’s data into a physical product,
       only create a physical product for that person’s personal and
       non-commercial use.
       [69][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    8. Don’t build an app whose primary purpose is to redirect people off
       of Facebook.
       [70][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
    9. If you want to use our logos or brand, follow the guidelines in the
       [71]Facebook Brand Resource and Permissions Center and [72]Brand
       Guidelines for Facebook Developers. Ad networks and data brokers
       must get our written permission before using our Platform, logos,
       or trademarks.
       [73][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931c8d1f6
       dfdda6685d10&amp;oe=5C4847B6]
   10. Don't sell, transfer or sublicense our code, APIs, or tools to
       anyone.
   11. Only use our SDKs to develop and distribute apps or content for use
       with the Facebook Platform. You may also distribute any object code
       or sample source code included in the SDKs for inclusion in such
       apps.
   12. Don’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse
       engineer any SDK or its components.
   13. Be honest about your relationship with Facebook when talking to the
       press or users. Comply with our Developer PR Guidelines and get
       approval from us before issuing any formal press release or blog
       post mentioning Facebook.
   14. If you use the Like button on iOS or Android, don’t collect or use
       any information from it.
   15. Sharing to Stories:
       a. Stories must not include any logos, watermarks, calls-to-action,
       or other promotional content.
       b. Additional policies for Stories with Attribution: (1) Stories
       must not be generic (i.e., only enable people to share unique and
       personal content). (2) If a person clicks on your Story, ensure you
       direct them to an experience that enhances the Story and/or enables
       them to create their own Story.

    1. You are responsible for restricting access to your content in
       accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, including

       claimed infringement, instituting a repeat infringer termination
       policy and implementing a notice and takedown process.
       b. In other countries, you must comply with local copyright laws
       and implement an appropriate notice and takedown process for when
       you receive a notice of claimed infringement.
    6. Don’t knowingly share information with us that you have collected
       from children under the age of 13.
    7. Web sites or services directed to children under 13: If you use
       Social Plugins or our JavaScript SDK for Facebook on sites and
       services that are directed to children under 13, you are
       responsible for complying with all applicable laws. For example, if
       your web site or service is directed to children in the United
       States, or knowingly collects personal information from children in
       the United States, you must comply with the U.S. Children’s Online
       Privacy Protection Act. You must also adhere to our [74]usage
       notes.
    8. Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction

       comply with the following:
       a. Only use an entity's data on behalf of the entity (i.e., only to
       provide services to that entity and not for your own business
       purposes or another entity's purposes).
       b. Don’t use an entity's data to build or augment user profiles.

    8. You grant us and our affiliates a non-exclusive, transferable,
       sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to host, use,

       your App.
    9. We or an independent auditor acting on our behalf may audit your

       button (ex: “purchase”, “submit”, “confirm”) that a person must
       click on prior to you sending a MessengerCheckboxUserConfirmation
       event (i.e., don’t send the event until after a person clicks on
       the button or takes an equivalent affirmative action (ex: submit
       form)).
    5. Service Providers:
       a. Ensure your agreements with businesses do not conflict with, and
       that businesses agree to, Facebook’s [126]Statement of Rights and
       Responsibilities, including these [127]Platform Policies.
       b. Ensure you have the authority to act as agent for the business
       to which you're providing a service, and that your use of our
       Platform is strictly for the benefit of that business.
       c. Don't facilitate or encourage any violations of our policies.
       For example, if you have permission to support businesses that are

       to ineligible services (see details below).
    6. Your app or bot should not receive excessive negative feedback. Be
       sure your app insights reflect a positive experience.

            below, and until the next interaction, you may send one

            c. Subscription-based messaging:
            i. Bots that primarily support the following use cases are
            eligible for subscription-based messaging, and these messages
            may be sent at any time provided people opt-in to receiving
            this content:

            advertising, marketing, solicitations, or promotional content,
            even if a person opts-in to receiving this content (ex: daily
            deals, coupons and discount or sale announcements are not
            permitted).
            [133][851547_537948159656190_540847388_n.png?oh=0c8f62cfee5931
