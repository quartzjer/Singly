Terms of Service

   Welcome to Facebook!
   These Terms govern your use of Facebook and the products, features,
   apps, services, technologies, and software we offer (the [62]Facebook
   Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate
   terms (and not these) apply.
   Return to top

1. Our Services

   Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring
   the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the
   Products and services described below to you:
   Provide a personalized experience for you:
   Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,
   stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our
   video platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might
   use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We use the data we have
   - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings
   you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to
   personalize your experience.
   Connect you with people and organizations you care about:
   We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,
   organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook
   Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you
   and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to
   follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to
   become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we
   believe our services are most useful when people are connected to
   people, groups, and organizations they care about.
   Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to
   you:
   There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to communicate
   with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for
   example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the
   Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several
   people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile.
   We also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to
   use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and
   share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.
   Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest
   you:
   We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you
   discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many
   businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook
   Products. Our partners pay us to show their content to you, and we
   design our services so that the sponsored content you see is as
   relevant and useful to you as everything else you see on our Products.
   Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:
   People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We
   employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical
   systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards
   others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect
   our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will
   take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content,
   blocking access to certain features, disabling an account, or
   contacting law enforcement. We share data with other [63]Facebook
   Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one
   of our Products.
   Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional
   services for everyone:
   We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial
   intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that
   people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or
   geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who
   have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos
   shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network
   and communication technology to help more people connect to the
   internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems
   to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous
   activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.
   Research ways to make our services better:
   We engage in research and collaborate with others to improve our
   Products. One way we do this is by analyzing the data we have and
   understanding how people use our Products. You can [64]learn more about
   some of our research efforts.
   Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company
   Products:
   Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,
   organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our
   systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the
   different [65]Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we
   use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier
   for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable
   you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through
   Messenger.
   Enable global access to our services:
   To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content
   and data in our data centers and systems around the world, including
   outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated
   or controlled by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or its
   affiliates.
   Return to top

2. Our Data Policy and Your Privacy Choices

   To provide these services, we must collect and use your personal data.
   We detail our practices in the [66]Data Policy, which you must agree to
   in order to use our Products.
   We also encourage you to review the privacy choices you have in your
   [67]settings.
   Return to top

3. Your Commitments to Facebook and Our Community

   We provide these services to you and others to help advance our
   mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:
   1. Who can use Facebook
   When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is
   safer and more accountable. For that reason, you must:
     * Use the same name that you use in everyday life.
     * Provide accurate information about yourself.
     * Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for
       personal purposes.
     * Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to
       others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our
       permission).

   We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot
   use Facebook if:
     * You are under 13 years old.
     * You are a convicted sex offender.
     * We previously disabled your account for violations of our terms or
       policies.
     * You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or
       software under applicable laws.

   2. What you can share and do on Facebook
   We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share
   content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety
   and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You
   therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to
   facilitate or support others in doing so):
    1. You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
          + That violates these Terms, our [68]Community Standards, and
            [69]other terms and policies that apply to your use of
            Facebook.
          + That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.
          + That infringes or violates someone else's rights.
    2. You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that
       could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or
       appearance of our Products.
    3. You may not access or collect data from our Products using
       automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access
       data you do not have permission to access.

   We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and,
   if applicable, we may take action against your account, for the
   [70]reasons described below. We may also disable your account if you
   repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights.
   To help support our community, we encourage you to [71]report content
   or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including
   [72]intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.
   3. The permissions you give us
   We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
    1. Permission to use content you create and share: You own the content
       you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Products
       you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have
       to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone
       else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we need
       you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.
       Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is
       covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on
       or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive,
       transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license
       to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or
       display, translate, and create derivative works of your content
       (consistent with your [73]privacy and [74]application settings).
       This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you
       give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again,
       consistent with your settings) such as service providers that
       support our service or other Facebook Products you use.
       You can end this license any time by deleting your content or
       account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you
       delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies
       (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition,
       content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it
       with others and they have not deleted it.
    2. Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about
       your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us permission
       to use your name and profile picture and information about actions
       you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads,
       offers, and other sponsored content that we display across our
       Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show
       your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have
       liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads
       on Facebook. Ads like this can be seen only by people who have your
       permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook. You can
       [75]learn more about your ad settings and preferences.
       If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you represent that a
       parent or legal guardian also agrees to this section on your
       behalf. (This language is included pursuant to a [76]court-approved
       legal settlement.)
    3. Permission to update software you use or download: If you download
       or use our software, you give us permission to download and install
       upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance, and
       further develop it.

   4. Limits on using our intellectual property
   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have
   and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs,
   videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or
   share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not
   yours). You can only use our copyrights or [77]trademarks (or any
   similar marks) as expressly permitted by our [78]Brand Usage Guidelines
   or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written
   permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify,
   create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract
   source code from us.
   Return to top

4. Additional provisions

   1. Updating our Terms
   We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to
   make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may
   need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our
   services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will
   notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an
   opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated
   Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use
   our Products.
   We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not
   agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the
   Facebook community, you can [79]delete your account at any time.
   2. Account suspension or termination
   We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to
   express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.
   If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may
   take action against your account to protect our community and services,
   including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may
   also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal
   exposure for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law.
   Where appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time
   you try to access it. You can [80]learn more about what you can do if
   your account has been disabled.
   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate
   as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will
   remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5
   3. Limits on liability
   We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear
   guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are
   provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be
   safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without
   disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law,
   we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what
   people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their
   actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they
   share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other
   objectionable content).
   We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products.
   Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent
   permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be
   liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or
   consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental
   damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Facebook
   Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
   damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these
   Terms or the Facebook Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or
   the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.
   4. Disputes
   We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid
   disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's
   useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will
   apply.
   For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that
   arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products
   ("claim"), you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S.
   District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court
   located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal
   jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating
   any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will
   govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law
   provisions.
   5. Other
    1. These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and
       Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and
       Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede
       any prior agreements.
    2. Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental
       terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be
       made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For
       instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or
       business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing
       apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our
       measurement services, you must agree to our [81]Commercial Terms.
       If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with
       our [82]Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms
       conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to
       the extent of the conflict.
    3. If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable, the
       remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail
       to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
       Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing
       and signed by us.
    4. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these
       Terms to anyone else without our consent.
    5. You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your
       account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a person
       who you have identified in a valid will or similar document
       expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or
       incapacity will be able to seek [83]disclosure from your account
       after it is memorialized.
    6. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All
       of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely
       assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale
       of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
    7. You should know that we may need to change the username for your
       account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else
       claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in
       everyday life).
    8. We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our
       products and services. But you should know that we may use them
       without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are
       under no obligation to keep them confidential.
    9. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
