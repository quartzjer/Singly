FOURSQUARE LABS, INC. API AND DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT

   This API and Data License Agreement ("Agreement”) applies to your
   access to, and use of, the content, documentation, code, data and
   related materials made available by Foursquare Labs, Inc.
   (“Foursquare”) to you (collectively, the “Content”), including through
   the use of the Foursquare application programming interface (the “API”,
   together with Content, “Foursquare Materials”). By using any Foursquare
   Materials you agree to this Agreement.

   1. WHO CAN USE FOURSQUARE MATERIALS - When you use the Foursquare
   Materials, you agree to form a binding contract with Foursquare, and
   follow this Agreement, the [24]Foursquare Platform Policy and all
   applicable laws. If you’re using the Foursquare Materials on behalf of
   a company, organization, or other entity, then you and that entity
   (collectively “Licensee”), represent and warrant that you’re authorized
   to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these terms and bind
   the entity to these terms, and that you agree to these terms on the
   entity’s behalf. Some of the Foursquare Materials may be code that you
   incorporate into Licensee’s applications, products and services
   (“Licensee Service”) that enable functionality. You agree that we may
   automatically update those Foursquare Materials, and this Agreement
   will apply to such updates.

   2. LICENSE REQUIREMENTS (NON-ENTERPRISE LICENSE) - Foursquare offers
   you access to the Foursquare Materials for free provided that your
   application: (a) is non-exclusive, (b) is publicly available, (c) does
   not require a fee or subscription, (d) does not exceed the daily call
   limits, and (e) is not otherwise commercial in nature. If your
   application does not meet all of these requirements, you will need to
   obtain an enterprise license.

   3. GRANT OF LICENSE - Subject to Licensee’s full compliance with all of
   the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the [25]Platform Policy,
   Foursquare grants Licensee a non-exclusive, revocable,
   nonsublicensable, nontransferable license to download and use the
   Foursquare Materials to (i) develop, implement and integrate with the
   Licensee Service and (ii) use, reproduce, distribute, transmit, display
   and perform the Foursquare Materials as part of the Licensee Service.
   Licensee may not install or use the Foursquare Materials for any other
   purpose without Foursquare's prior written consent. Licensee shall not
   use the Foursquare Materials in connection with or to promote any
   products, services, or materials that constitute, promote or are used
   primarily for the purpose of dealing in: spyware, adware, or other
   malicious programs or code, counterfeit goods, items subject to U.S.
   embargo, unsolicited mass distribution of email ("spam"), multi-level
   marketing proposals, hate materials,
   hacking/surveillance/interception/descrambling equipment, libelous,
   defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive or otherwise offensive
   content, prostitution, body parts and bodily fluids, stolen products
   and items used for theft, fireworks, explosives, and hazardous
   materials, government IDs, police items, gambling, professional
   services regulated by state licensing regimes, non-transferable items
   such as airline tickets or event tickets, weapons and accessories,
   automatic or autonomous control of vehicles, aircraft or other
   mechanical devices, dispatch or fleet management, or emergency or
   life-saving purposes. For Licensee Services that provide real-time
   route guidance, Licensee must have an end user license agreement that
   includes the following notice: YOUR USE OF THIS APPLICATION IS AT YOUR
   SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.

   4. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS - As between Foursquare and Licensee, the
   Foursquare Materials, including any and all Content made available,
   collected and/or derived through the API (including, without
   limitation, user data received from the API or submitted to the API),
   and all intellectual property rights in and to all of the foregoing,
   are and shall at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of
   Foursquare and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws
   and treaties.

   5. OTHER RESTRICTIONS - Except as expressly and unambiguously
   authorized under this Agreement, Licensee may not (i) copy, rent,
   lease, sell, transfer, assign, sublicense, disassemble, reverse
   engineer or decompile (except to the limited extent expressly
   authorized by applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of
   the Foursquare Materials; (ii) otherwise use the Foursquare Materials
   on behalf of any third party; or (iii) design or permit the Licensee
   Service to disable, override or otherwise interfere with any
   Foursquare-implemented communications to end users, consent panels,
   user settings, alerts, warnings or the like, including but not limited
   to those intended to notify the end user that his or her user data or
   location data is being collected or used, or intended to obtain consent
   for such collection or use. Foursquare expressly reserves the right to
   limit the number and/or frequency of API requests in its sole
   discretion.

   6. MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT. Foursquare reserves the right, in
   its sole discretion to modify this Agreement and/or the Foursquare
   Platform Policy at any time by posting a notice to
   developer.foursquare.com. You shall be responsible for reviewing and
   becoming familiar with any such modification. Such modifications are
   effective upon first posting or notification and use of the Foursquare
   Materials by Licensee following any such notification constitutes
   Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
   modified.

   7. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER - THE FOURSQUARE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW, FOURSQUARE AND ITS VENDORS EACH DISCLAIM ALL
   WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE
   FOURSQUARE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY AND ALL IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, RESULTS OF USE, RELIABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, INTERFERENCE WITH QUIET
   ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. FURTHER,
   FOURSQUARE DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT LICENSEE'S USE OF THE FOURSQUARE
   MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.

   8. SUPPORT AND UPGRADES - This Agreement does not entitle Licensee to
   any support for the Foursquare Materials, unless Licensee makes
   separate arrangements with Foursquare and pays all fees associated with
   such support. Any such support provided by Foursquare shall be subject
   to the terms of this Agreement as modified by the associated support
   agreement.

   9. LIABILITY LIMITATION - REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH
   HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, AND EXCEPT FOR
   BODILY INJURY, IN NO EVENT WILL FOURSQUARE OR ITS VENDORS, BE LIABLE TO
   LICENSEE OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER ANY TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE,
   STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR (A) ANY LOST
   PROFITS, LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
   INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
   TO USE THE FOURSQUARE MATERIALS OR (B) ANY DAMAGES, IN THE AGGREGATE,
   IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500.00), EVEN IF FOURSQUARE HAS
   BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES AND WHETHER OR
   NOT SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE. ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
   RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER
   THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM. IN ADDITION,
   FOURSQUARE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY OF ANY KIND OF FOURSQUARE'S VENDORS.

   10. INDEMNITY - Licensee agrees that Foursquare shall have no liability
   whatsoever for any use Licensee makes of the Foursquare Materials.
   Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Foursquare from any and all
   claims, damages, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable
   attorneys' fees) arising from Licensee's use of the Foursquare
   Materials.

   11. TERM AND TERMINATION - This Agreement shall continue until
   terminated as set forth in this Section. Either party may terminate
   this Agreement at any time, for any reason, or for no reason including,
   but not limited to, if Licensee violates any provision of this
   Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement shall also terminate the
   license granted hereunder. Upon termination of this Agreement for any
   reason, Licensee shall cease using, destroy and remove from all
   computers, hard drives, networks, and other storage media all copies of
   the Foursquare Materials (including all user data), and shall so
   certify to Foursquare that such actions have occurred. Foursquare shall
   have the right to inspect and audit Licensee's facilities to confirm
   the foregoing. Sections 8 through 13 and all accrued rights to payment
   shall survive termination of this Agreement.

   12. GOVERNMENT USE - If Licensee is part of an agency, department, or
   other entity of the United States Government ("Government"), the use,
   duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or
   transfer of the Foursquare Materials are restricted in accordance with
   the Federal Acquisition Regulations as applied to civilian agencies and
   the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement as applied to
   military agencies. The Foursquare Materials are a "commercial item,"
   "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
   documentation." In accordance with such provisions, any use of the
   Foursquare Materials by the Government shall be governed solely by the
   terms of this Agreement.

   13. EXPORT CONTROLS - Licensee shall comply with all export laws and
   restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce, the United
   States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control
   ("OFAC"), or other United States or foreign agency or authority, and
   Licensee shall not export, or allow the export or re-export of the
   Foursquare Materials in violation of any such restrictions, laws or
   regulations. By downloading or using the Foursquare Materials, Licensee
   agrees to the foregoing and represents and warrants that Licensee is
   not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any
   restricted country.

   14. MISCELLANEOUS - Unless the parties have entered into a written
   amendment to this agreement that is signed by both parties regarding
   the Foursquare Materials, this Agreement and the Foursquare Platform
   Policy constitute the entire agreement between Licensee and Foursquare
   pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all
   written or oral agreements with respect to such subject matter. This
   Agreement, and any disputes arising from or relating to the
   interpretation thereof, shall be governed by and construed under New
   York law as such law applies to agreements between New York residents
   entered into and to be performed within New York by two residents
   thereof and without reference to its conflict of laws principles or the
   United Nations Conventions for the International Sale of Goods. Except
   to the extent otherwise determined by Foursquare, any action or
   proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement must be brought
   in a federal court in the Southern District of New York or in state
   court in New York County, New York, and each party irrevocably submits
   to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or
   proceeding. The prevailing party in any action arising out of this
   Agreement shall be entitled to an award of its costs and attorneys'
   fees. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by
   Foursquare. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
   unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to
   the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The failure of Foursquare
   to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Licensee or others
   does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit Foursquare's rights
   with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. This Agreement
   is personal to Licensee and may not be assigned or transferred for any
   reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law,
   merger, reorganization, or as a result of an acquisition or change of
   control involving Licensee) without Foursquare's prior written consent
   and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void
   and without effect. Foursquare expressly reserves the right to assign
   this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.
