LinkedIn APIs Terms of Use

   Thu, 10/22/2009 - 21:36 — [43]LIDeveloperAdmin

   Introduction

   Thank you for using the LinkedIn APIs. LinkedIn makes its application
   programming interfaces (LinkedIn APIs" or "APIs") available to you to
   facilitate the development of innovative applications with a
   professional context using LinkedIn data and developer tools. If you
   want to use the LinkedIn APIs outside the scope of these Terms and
   Conditions, or to build and/or distribute enterprise applications
   outside your own company (e.g. use the APIs to build an Application
   that you distribute to other companies), please contact our Enterprise
   Relations Team at: enterprise-program@linkedin.com.

   By using one or more of the LinkedIn APIs, you and, if applicable, the
   company you represent (collectively, "you") accept and agree to be
   bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Use" or
   "Terms"). It is important that you read these Terms as they form a
   legal agreement between you and LinkedIn Corporation ("LinkedIn", "we",
   or "us").

   In addition to the content in this document, the following are
   incorporated into the Terms (and references to "Terms" shall mean this
   document and those incorporated by reference):
    1. The LinkedIn User Agreement, which is located at
       [44]http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=user_agreement;
    2. The LinkedIn Privacy Policy, which is located at
       [45]http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=privacy_policy;
    3. The [46]Platform Guidelines, which are located at the LinkedIn
       Developer Network site at developer.linkedin.com ("Developer
       Site"); and
    4. The [47]Branding Guidelines, which are also located at the
       Developer Site.

   In the event of any conflict between the content in this document and
   the documents incorporated by reference, this document shall control
   with respect to your use of the APIs. If you disagree with any of the
   provisions in these Terms, do not click that you agree to them, and do
   not accept, access or use the APIs.

   LinkedIn reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice
   to you, to change these Terms in our sole and absolute discretion. The
   most current version of these Terms can be reviewed on the LinkedIn
   developer portal at anytime and supersedes all previous versions. By
   using the LinkedIn APIs after changes are made to the Terms, you agree
   to be bound by such changes. Your only recourse if you disagree with
   the Terms, or changes to the Terms, is to discontinue your use of the
   APIs. Accordingly, we recommend you review these Terms periodically.

   1 Description, Licenses, and Restrictions

   1.1 Description of LinkedIn APIs. The APIs consist of programmatic web
   APIs and associated tools and documentation that allow you to create
   software application(s) or website(s) (your "Application") using
   certain data and content from the LinkedIn website at
   [48]www.linkedin.com ("Website"), made accessible by LinkedIn in its
   sole discretion (the "Content"). While LinkedIn strives to have its
   APIs available continuously, it cannot guarantee any up-time for any
   LinkedIn developer resource, including the APIs.

   1.2 Developer Accounts and Access Codes. To obtain the necessary
   security keys, secrets, tokens, passwords and/or other credentials to
   access the APIs (collectively, "Access Codes" or "API Keys"), you must
   create a account through LinkedIn's developer portal at:
   [49]http://developer.linkedin.com ("Developer Account"). You are
   responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your Access
   Codes, and all activities that occur using your Access Codes, are your
   responsibility. In order to maintain accurate information (including a
   current email address and other required contact information) related
   your account, you must keep your Developer Account information
   up-to-date.

   1.3 APIs License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions in these
   Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable or
   non-transferable license under LinkedIn's intellectual property rights
   during the Term to use the APIs to develop, test, and support your
   Application, and to distribute or allow access to your integration of
   the APIs within your Application to end users of your Application. You
   have no right to distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs.

   1.4 Brand Features License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions
   of these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable
   and non-transferable license during the Term to display our trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, logos and domain names that we make
   available to you in our discretion via the Branding Guidelines
   available on our Developer Site (collectively, "Brand Features") to
   promote or advertise your integration of the APIs in your Application.
   You agree that your use and display of the Brand Features will at all
   times be consistent with the Branding Guidelines, and any other
   branding, trademark, or similar guidelines included in the Platform
   Guidelines. In particular, you agree not to display our Brand Features
   in any way that is misleading, defamatory, infringing, libelous,
   disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable to LinkedIn, or in a
   way that suggests we have created, sponsored, or endorsed your
   Application or its content.

   Terms, you agree not to do any of the following, unless expressly
   permitted by LinkedIn in these Terms or in writing by LinkedIn:

   Application.

   provision of such support or modifications to you at any time without
   notice or liability to you. We may release subsequent versions of the
   APIs and require that you use such subsequent versions. Your continued
   use of the APIs following a subsequent release will be deemed your
   acceptance of modifications.

   1.7 Fees. The APIs are currently provided for free, but LinkedIn
   reserves the right to charge for the APIs in the future. If we do
   charge a fee for use of the APIs or any developer tools and features,
   you do not have any obligation to continue to use the LinkedIn's

   or terminate your access to the APIs.

   1.9 Usage Limitations. LinkedIn may limit the number of network calls
   that your Application may make via the APIs, and/or the maximum Content
   that may be accessed, or anything else about the APIs and the Content
   it accesses as LinkedIn deems appropriate in its sole discretion. The
   usage limitations can be found in the LinkedIn developer portal at
   [50]http://developer.linkedin.com/. LinkedIn may change such usage
   limits at any time. In addition to its other rights under these Terms,
   LinkedIn may utilize technical measures to prevent over-usage and/or
   stop usage of the APIs by an Application after any usage limitations
   are exceeded. If no limits are stated in the Platform Guidelines, you
   nevertheless agree to use the APIs in a manner that, as determined by
   us in our sole discretion, exceeds reasonable request volume or
   constitutes excessive or abusive usage.

   1.10 Security Measures. Your networks, operating system and the
   software of your web server(s), routers, databases, and computer
   systems (collectively, "System" or "Systems") must be properly
   configured to Internet industry standards as required to securely
   operate your Application. You will not architect or select Systems in a
   manner to avoid the foregoing obligation. You must promptly report any
   security deficiencies in or intrusions to your Systems that you
   discover to LinkedIn in writing via email to [51]support@linkedin.com
   or subsequent contact information posted in the Developer Site. You
   will work with LinkedIn to immediately correct any security deficiency,
   and will disconnect immediately any intrusions or intruder. In the
   event of security deficiency or intrusion involving the Application,
   you will make no public statements (i.e. press, blogs, bulletin boards,
   etc.) without prior written and express permission from LinkedIn in
   each instance.

   1.11 LinkedIn Independent Development. You understand and acknowledge
   that LinkedIn may be independently creating applications, content and
   other products or services that may be similar to or competitive with
   your Application, and nothing in these Terms will be construed as
   restricting or preventing LinkedIn from creating and fully exploiting
   such applications, content and other items, without any obligation to
   you.

   2 Proprietary Rights

   2.1 LinkedIn Property. As between you and us, we own all rights, title,
   and interest, including without limitation all intellectual property
   rights, in and to, the (i) APIs, and all elements, components, and
   executables of the APIs; (ii) the Content available from the APIs;
   (iii) our Website; and (iv) our Brand Features (collectively, the
   "LinkedIn Materials"). Except for the express licenses granted in these
   Terms, LinkedIn does not grant you any right, title or interest in the
   LinkedIn Materials. You agree to take such actions, including, without
   limitation, execution of affidavits or other documents, as LinkedIn may
   reasonably request to effect, perfect or confirm LinkedIn's rights to
   the LinkedIn Materials.

   2.2 Feedback. You have no obligation to give us any suggestions,
   comments or other feedback ("Feedback") relating to the LinkedIn
   Materials. However, we may use and include any Feedback that you
   voluntarily provide to improve the LinkedIn Materials and/or any other
   of our products, services or technologies. Accordingly, if you give
   Feedback, you agree that we may freely use, reproduce, license, and
   distribute such Feedback. You also agree not to provide Feedback that
   you know is subject to any intellectual property claim by a third party
   or any license terms which would require products or services derived
   from such Feedback to be licensed to or from, or shared with, any third
   party.

   2.3 Application. You represent and warrant to LinkedIn that, excluding
   LinkedIn Property, you have the right to use, reproduce, transmit,
   copy, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your
   Application, and that use by LinkedIn and its users of your Application
   shall not violate the rights of any third party (e.g., copyright,
   patent, trademark, or other proprietary right of any person or entity),
   or any applicable regulation or law, including the laws of any country
   in which your Application is made available. Except to the extent your
   Application contains LinkedIn Property, LinkedIn claims no ownership or
   control over your Application. During the term of these Terms you
   hereby grant to us a paid-up, royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide
   irrevocable right and license, under all of your intellectual property
   rights, to: (i) use, perform, and display your Application and its
   content for purposes of marketing, demonstrating, and making your
   Application available to users; (ii) link to and direct users to your
   Application; and (iii) sublicense the foregoing rights to our
   affiliates. Following the termination of these Terms and upon written
   request from you, LinkedIn shall make commercially reasonable efforts,
   as determined in its sole discretion, to remove all references and
   links to your Application from the LinkedIn website and service.
   LinkedIn shall have no other obligation to delete copies of, references
   to, or links to, your Application.

   3 Privacy, Policies, and Legal Compliance

   3.1 LinkedIn's Privacy Policy. LinkedIn's collection and use of
   personal information from its users and developers is governed by
   LinkedIn's Privacy Policy, available at
   [52]http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=privacy_policy and incorporated
   by reference into these Terms, with the exception that LinkedIn may
   reveal personal information about developers for attribution purposes,
   handling inquiries from users or potential users, and other purposes
   LinkedIn reasonably deems necessary pursuant to these Terms. You
   understand and agree that LinkedIn may access, preserve, and disclose
   your personal information and your developer account details if
   required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access,
   preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with
   legal process or protect the rights, property and/or safety of
   LinkedIn, its affiliates or partners, its users, or the general public.

   3.2 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You will post a policy complying
   with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and respond promptly
   to notices of alleged copyright infringement involving your
   Application.

   3.3 Your Policies; Informed Consent. You will (a) maintain your own
   user agreement and privacy policy applicable to users of the
   Application (your "Policies"), (b) comply with your Policies, (c)
   prominently identify and link to your Policies at those locations where
   users may opt to download or access your Application, and (d) promptly
   notify us of any breaches of your Policies by you or users of the
   Application. Your privacy policy will be at least as stringent and
   user-friendly as LinkedIn's. Before obtaining information from your
   users of the Application, you will obtain their informed consent by
   informing them what information you collect and how it will be used
   and/or shared.

   3.4 Data Storage and Conversion Limits.

   3.4.1 Prohibition on Copying and Storage. You may not copy, store or
   cache any Content returned or received through the APIs, including data
   about users, longer than the current usage session of the user for
   which it was obtained, except for the alphanumeric user IDs (Member
   Tokens) which we provide you for identifying users or any individual
   member's authentication token (OAuth Token) which we provide you when a
   LinkedIn user authenticates your Application to his LinkedIn account.

   3.4.2 Exceptions. You may store the Member Token and the OAuth Token
   until the earlier of:
     * Your ceasing using the APIs;
     * The LinkedIn user uninstalls your application or directs you to
       delete the user's information; or,
     * We terminate your use of them for breach of these Terms.

   3.4.3 Exception to Storage and Conversion Limits with User Consent. The
   restrictions of this section do not apply to user profile data received
   through a one-time call through the APIs that a user explicitly permits
   you to collect and store, provided that you obtain the user's consent
   through the technical and user-interface specifications provided by
   LinkedIn, and that any subsequent update to the profile data only be
   done with the user's explicit consent. PLEASE NOTE: a) User profile
   data does not include information about a user's connections, which may
   not be copied or stored; and b) you may only use stored profile data
   for the benefit of the LinkedIn user that granted you permission to
   access it.

   3.4.4 Removal of LinkedIn User Data from Your System. Also, you must
   remove all data collected with the user's consent upon request by the
   user, when the user uninstalls your Application, or when the user
   closes his or her account with you. The restrictions of this section
   also do not apply to "Independent Data," which means data that users
   provide directly to you and that is separately entered, uploaded, or
   presented to you by the user of your Application.

   3.4.5 Data from the Apply with LinkedIn Plugin. Content obtained from
   the Apply with LinkedIn Plugin is provided solely for the use of the
   hiring company that is accepting applications for an open position and
   cannot be used to create or populate a profile on a third party
   service, or to create an application template used across multiple job
   applications.

   4 Marketing and Publicity

   4.1 Your Marketing and Publicity. You may promote your Application,
   including talking to traditional and online media and your users about
   your Application, so long as you do so truthfully and without implying
   that your Application is created or endorsed by LinkedIn (or otherwise
   embellishing your relationship with LinkedIn). However, you may not
   issue any formal press release via traditional or online media
   referring to LinkedIn without LinkedIn's prior consent, unless
   expressly allowed in the Guidelines for Use of LinkedIn Brand Features.

   4.2 LinkedIn's Marketing and Publicity. We may publicly refer to you,
   orally or in writing, as a licensee of the LinkedIn APIs and we may
   publish your name and/or logo (with or without a link to your
   Application) on our Website, in press releases, and in promotional
   materials without your prior consent.

   5 Confidentiality. The term "LinkedIn Confidential Information" means
   any information of or relating to LinkedIn that becomes known to you
   through disclosure, observation or otherwise, and that either is
   designated as confidential by LinkedIn or that is not generally known
   or readily ascertainable to the public, including, without limitation,
   nonpublic information regarding LinkedIn's APIs and LinkedIn's
   products, services, programs, features, data, techniques, technology,
   code, ideas, inventions, research, testing, methods, procedures,
   know-how, trade secrets, business and financial information and other
   activities. All LinkedIn Confidential Information remains the property
   of LinkedIn, and no license or other right in any LinkedIn Confidential
   Information is granted hereby. You will not disclose any LinkedIn
   Confidential Information to any third party, and will take all
   reasonable precautions to prevent its unauthorized dissemination, both
   during and after the term of these Terms. If you are a corporate
   entity, you will limit your internal distribution of LinkedIn
   Confidential Information to your employees and agents who have a need
   to know, and will take steps to ensure that dissemination is so
   limited. You will not use any LinkedIn Confidential Information for the
   benefit of anyone other than LinkedIn. Upon LinkedIn's written request,
   you will destroy or return to LinkedIn all LinkedIn Confidential
   Information in your custody or control. In addition to the terms of
   this provision, you and LinkedIn will continue to be subject to any
   non-disclosure agreement that you and LinkedIn have entered into
   separately. This provision will survive any termination of these Terms.

   6 Term and Termination

   6.1 Term. The term of these Terms of Use shall commence on the date
   upon which you agree to the Terms and shall continue in force
   thereafter, unless modified or terminated as provided herein.

   6.2 LinkedIn Termination; Suspension; Discontinuance. We may suspend or
   terminate your use of all or any of the APIs at any time if we believe
   you have violated these Terms, the User Agreement, the Platform
   Guidelines, or, in our sole discretion, we believe the availability of
   the APIs in your Application is not in our or our users' best
   interests. We may discontinue the availability of some or all of the
   APIs at any time for any reason. We may also impose limits on certain
   features and services or restrict your access to some or all of the
   APIs or our Website. All of our rights herein may be exercised without
   prior notice or liability to you.

   6.3 Your Termination. You may terminate the agreement under these Terms
   for any reason or no reason at all, at your convenience, by closing
   your account or ceasing use of the APIs.

   6.4 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the agreement between
   you and us under these Terms, (a) all rights and licenses granted to
   you will terminate immediately, (b) any and all payment obligations, if
   any, will be due, (c) you will promptly destroy LinkedIn Confidential
   Information in your possession or control, and (d) unless we agree
   otherwise in writing or as stated in these Terms, you must permanently
   delete all Content or other data which you stored pursuant to your use
   of the APIs, except as expressly permitted by these Terms of the
   Platform Guidelines. LinkedIn may request that you certify in writing
   your compliance with this section. No liability shall be created for
   either party by the mere fact of termination of the agreement under
   these Terms. The following sections of these Terms shall survive
   termination: Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.11, 2, 3, and 5-10.

   6.5 Remedies. You acknowledge that your breach of these Terms may cause
   irreparable harm to LinkedIn, the extent of which would be difficult to
   ascertain. Accordingly, you agree that, in addition to any other
   remedies to which LinkedIn may be legally entitled, LinkedIn shall have
   the right to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event of a breach
   of these Terms by you or any of your officers, employees, consultants
   or other agents.

   10. General Terms

   10.1 Governing Law; Attorneys Fees. These Terms will be governed by and
   construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California as
   such laws apply to contracts between California residents performed
   entirely within California. Any action or proceeding arising from or
   relating to these Terms must be brought in a federal court in the
   Northern District of California or in state court in Santa Clara
   County, California and each party irrevocably submits to the
   jurisdiction and venue of any such court. In the event of litigation
   between the parties arising out of or related to these Terms, the
   prevailing party will be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and
   costs incurred.

   10.2 Interpretation. The term "include" (and all of its variants) when
   used in these Terms will be interpreted to be followed by the clause
   "without limitation" in all cases. You agree that LinkedIn has sole
   discretion in determining the interpretation of the meaning of these
   Terms, including determining your compliance with these Terms.

   10.3 Export Laws. You shall comply with applicable export laws and
   regulations of the United States with respect to any technical
   materials you receive pursuant to these Terms.

   10.4 Waiver. The failure of LinkedIn to exercise or enforce any right
   or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right
   or provision.

   10.5 Severability of Terms. If any provision of these Terms is found by
   a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
   nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
   parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
   provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect

   10.6 Applicability and Entirety of Terms. These Terms do not apply to
   you if you and LinkedIn have executed a written API License Agreement,
   in which case such Agreement applies. In all other cases, these Terms
   apply to you, they constitute the entire agreement between you and us
   with respect to the subject matter herein, and they supersede any and
   all prior proposals (oral and written), understandings, representations
   and other communications between you and us.

   construed as creating a partnership or joint venture of any kind
   between the parties and neither party will have the authority or power
   to bind the other party or to contract in the name of or create a
   liability against the other party in any way or for any purpose.

   10.8 Assignment. You may not assign these Terms, in whole or in part,
   without LinkedIn's prior written consent. Any assignment in violation
   of this section is null and void.
